**Route Optimization for Starbucks Delivery: Python Simulation and Analysis**

This project demonstrates route optimization using Python for Starbucks store delivery logistics. By leveraging geospatial data and network analysis, the simulation identifies efficient paths for delivery personnel while reducing travel time and costs.

*Features*:
- City-specific Dataset: Uses real-world Starbucks store data with latitude, longitude, and address information.  
- Graph-based Network: Constructs a road network graph for optimal route calculations.  
- Efficient Pathfinding: Implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find shortest paths between delivery locations.  
- Visualization: Generates detailed maps with nodes, edges, and optimal routes marked for clarity.  
- Scalability: Applicable to various cities and customizable for different business requirements.  

*Dataset*:
- Source: The dataset contains information about stores, their geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), and addresses.
- Format: CSV file with columns for city, street address, latitude, longitude, and node IDs.

*Technologies Used*
- Python Libraries:  
  - `osmnx`: For road network creation and route optimization.  
  - `networkx`: For graph operations and shortest path algorithms.  
  - `folium`: For interactive map visualizations.  
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- Development Tools:  
  - Jupyter Notebook for development and testing.  
  - Visualization tools to plot and analyze routes.  

*How It Works*:
1. Dataset Preparation: Reads CSV data containing store locations.  
2. Graph Construction: Generates a road network graph using OpenStreetMap data.  
3. Node Mapping: Identifies the nearest graph nodes to store locations using geographic coordinates.  
4. Route Optimization:  
   - Calculates the shortest path from a starting node to destination nodes.  
   - Visualizes routes and marks delivery paths with nodes and edges.  
5. Visualization: Produces interactive maps with labeled nodes and edges for clarity.

*Use Cases*:
- Quick Commerce: Tailored for services like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto to optimize fast delivery routes.  
- Delivery Logistics: Enhances efficiency for businesses requiring geospatial route optimization.  
- Scalable Applications: Adaptable to different cities and delivery scenarios.
